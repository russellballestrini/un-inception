## Test Duration by Language

The primary performance metric - how long each language takes to run its full test suite (15 tests per language).

![Duration by Language](chart-duration-by-language.png)

**Key observations:**
- **RUST** and **C** are outliers at 90+ seconds
- Most languages cluster between 20-40 seconds
- Compiled languages (red) tend to be faster than interpreted (blue)
- **V** is the fastest at 40 seconds

---

## Compiled vs Interpreted

Comparing performance between compiled languages (C, Go, Rust, etc.) and interpreted languages (Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.).

![Category Comparison](chart-category-comparison.png)

**Findings:**
- 20 compiled languages vs 22 interpreted
- Compiled languages have lower median execution time
- Interpreted languages show more variance (wider spread)
- The white diamond marks the mean for each category

---

## Duration Distribution

Histogram showing how test durations are distributed across all 42 languages.

![Duration Histogram](chart-duration-histogram.png)

**Distribution analysis:**
- Most languages complete in 20-35 seconds (the peak)
- Mean (green dashed) and median (blue dotted) are close together
- Long tail on the right from slow outliers (rust, c)

---

## Speed Leaders

Side-by-side comparison of the 10 slowest and 10 fastest languages.

**Slowest (left):** RUST, C, PYTHON, TYPESCRIPT, JAVASCRIPT
**Fastest (right):** V, D, KOTLIN, AWK, RAKU

## Queue vs Execution Time

Scatter plot showing the relationship between CI queue wait time and actual test execution time.

![Queue vs Execution](chart-queue-vs-execution.png)

**Notes:**
- Queue time is how long the job waited for a runner
- Most jobs had similar queue times (clustered vertically)
- Outliers labeled - rust and c took longest to execute regardless of queue time
