## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tests | 848 |
| Passed | 806 |
| Failed | 42 |
| Pass Rate | 95.0% |
| Languages | 43 |
| Avg Duration | 175s |
| Slowest | go (447s) |
| Fastest | v (65s) |

---

## API Health

Tracks transient errors encountered during test execution. Tests retry on failures to ensure accurate results.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Health Score | 0/100 |
| Total Retries | 330 |
| Rate Limit (429) | 320 |
| Server Error (5xx) | 0 |
| Timeout | 10 |
| Connection | 0 |
| Tests Needing Retries | 116 |

**Interpretation:**
- **Score 95-100:** API is healthy, minimal transient errors
- **Score 80-94:** Some API instability, but tests recovered via retry
- **Score < 80:** Significant API issues affecting test reliability

---

## Test Duration by Language

The primary performance metric - how long each language takes to run its full test suite (15 tests per language).

![Duration by Language](chart-duration-by-language.png)

**Key observations:**
- **GO** and **CRYSTAL** are outliers at 90+ seconds
- Most languages cluster between 20-40 seconds
- Compiled languages (red) tend to be faster than interpreted (blue)
- **V** is the fastest at 65 seconds

---

## Compiled vs Interpreted

Comparing performance between compiled languages (C, Go, Rust, etc.) and interpreted languages (Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.).

![Category Comparison](chart-category-comparison.png)

**Findings:**
- 20 compiled languages vs 22 interpreted
- Compiled languages have lower median execution time
- Interpreted languages show more variance (wider spread)
- The white diamond marks the mean for each category

---

## Duration Distribution

Histogram showing how test durations are distributed across all 43 languages.

![Duration Histogram](chart-duration-histogram.png)

**Distribution analysis:**
- Most languages complete in 20-35 seconds (the peak)
- Mean (green dashed) and median (blue dotted) are close together
- Long tail on the right from slow outliers (go, crystal)

---

## Speed Leaders

Side-by-side comparison of the 10 slowest and 10 fastest languages.

**Slowest (left):** GO, CRYSTAL, RAKU, TYPESCRIPT, KOTLIN
**Fastest (right):** V, R, DART, PERL, RUST

---

## Queue vs Execution Time

Scatter plot showing the relationship between CI queue wait time and actual test execution time.

![Queue vs Execution](chart-queue-vs-execution.png)

**Notes:**
- Queue time is how long the job waited for a runner
- Most jobs had similar queue times (clustered vertically)
- Outliers labeled - go and crystal took longest to execute regardless of queue time
