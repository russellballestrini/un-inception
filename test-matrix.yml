# Auto-generated test matrix placeholder
# This file is overwritten by the generate-matrix job during CI/CD runs
# It exists as a placeholder so GitLab can parse .gitlab-ci.yml

# The generate-matrix job in .gitlab-ci.yml creates the actual test jobs
# based on which files changed (via scripts/detect-changes.sh)
