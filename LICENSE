PUBLIC DOMAIN, NO LICENSE, NO WARRANTY

This is free public domain software for the public good of a permacomputer hosted
at permacomputer.com, an always-on computer by the people, for the people. One
which is durable, easy to repair, & distributed like tap water for machine
learning intelligence.

The permacomputer is community-owned infrastructure optimized around four values:

  TRUTH      First principles, math & science, open source code freely distributed
  FREEDOM    Voluntary partnerships, freedom from tyranny & corporate control
  HARMONY    Minimal waste, self-renewing systems with diverse thriving connections
  LOVE       Be yourself without hurting others, cooperation through natural law

This software contributes to that vision by enabling code execution across 42+
programming languages through a unified interface, accessible to all. Code is
seeds to sprout on any abandoned technology.

Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute this
software, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose,
commercial or non-commercial, & by any means.

NO WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

That said, our permacomputer's digital membrane stratum continuously runs unit,
integration, & functional tests on all of it's own software, with our
permacomputer monitoring itself, repairing itself, with minimal human in the
loop guidance. Our machine learning agents do their best to leave no stone unturned.
