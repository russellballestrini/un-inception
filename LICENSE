PUBLIC DOMAIN - NO LICENSE, NO WARRANTY

This is free public domain software for the public good of a permacomputer hosted
at permacomputer.com - an always-on computer by the people, for the people. One
which is durable, easy to repair, and distributed like tap water for machine
learning intelligence.

The permacomputer is community-owned infrastructure optimized around four values:

  TRUTH    - Source code must be open source & freely distributed
  FREEDOM  - Voluntary participation without corporate control
  HARMONY  - Systems operating with minimal waste that self-renew
  LOVE     - Individual rights protected while fostering cooperation

This software contributes to that vision by enabling code execution across 42+
programming languages through a unified interface, accessible to all. Code is
seeds to sprout on any abandoned technology.

Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute this
software, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose,
commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

NO WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

That said, our permacomputer's digital membrane stratum continuously runs unit,
integration, and functional tests on all of it's own software - with our
permacomputer monitoring itself, repairing itself, with minimal human in the
loop guidance. Our agents do their best.
